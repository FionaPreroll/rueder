# rueder server

The new server of rueder: one Rust program (axum, tokio, sqlx) next to PostgreSQL.
It replaces `backend/` once it can do what the plan asks of it. Plan, architecture
and work packages are in [docs/](../docs/implementation.md) (German).

## State: foundation and data

What is here:

- The schema (`migrations/0001_initial.sql`, comments in German).
- The article store (`src/articles.rs`): three tables, so that lists never read
  text and old versions never touch what new articles are read from. One query
  serves the lists of a feed, a folder and all feeds.
- What an account has read (`src/reading.rs`): a mark per subscription plus the
  exceptions; unread counts are worked out from them, never stored.
- Made-up data in the size of a real installation and timings of these queries
  (`src/bench.rs`).
- `GET /api/health`, and the built frontend from `../web/build`.

Still to come in this step: the import of the old database. Fetching, cleaning,
login and the rest of the API follow in step 2.

## Commands

Rust (stable) and PostgreSQL 16.

```sh
cp .env.example .env                 # DATABASE_URL
cargo run                            # applies the migrations, serves on http://127.0.0.1:3000
cargo test                           # creates a database per test on the server of DATABASE_URL
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo sqlx prepare -- --all-targets  # after changing a query: renew the cache in .sqlx/
```

Queries are checked against the schema when compiling. Without a database the
build uses the cache in `.sqlx/` (`SQLX_OFFLINE=true`, as in CI); `cargo sqlx` comes
with `cargo install sqlx-cli`.

Settings come from the environment or `.env`: `DATABASE_URL`, `LISTEN_ADDR`
(default `127.0.0.1:3000`) and `STATIC_DIR` (default `../web/build`).

## Measuring

```sh
cargo run --release -- bench generate   # 10 accounts, 300 feeds, 10 million articles
cargo run --release -- bench measure    # times the queries, prints a table
```

`bench generate` wants an empty database and takes `--accounts`, `--feeds` and
`--articles`. Results and how they were measured are in
[docs/implementation.md](../docs/implementation.md#messung).
